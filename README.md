OS Assignment 2

To compile all programs run:
    make all

To delete all compiled files and output run:
    make clean

To run the program enter the memory management type
then the input file name. (./{MemoryManagement} {InputFile})
Example:
    ./firstFit first-names.txt
    ./bestFit first-names.txt
    ./worstFit first-names.txt

After running the program an "output.txt" file will
be created, displaying the memory used, as well as 
the contents of each list.
